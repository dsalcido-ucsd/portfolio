          <figcaption>Figure 1. NYC CCRB (1985–2020). Officers ranked by substantiated officer–complaint links; grouped into equal 5% bins. Bars encode share of all proven links; dashed line = 5% fair-share.</figcaption>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <h4>FOR the Proposition — Figure 1</h4>
        <ul class="method-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Unit &amp; “proven” definition (officer–complaint pairs)</strong>
            <div class="score">Score: +1.5 (earnest)</div>
            <p>I de-duplicated to one record per officer–complaint pair and limited the numerator to CCRB-substantiated outcomes. This guards against double-counting and keeps the claim about proven misconduct. I considered using “any discipline” or “all allegations,” but those blur the evidentiary bar and dilute the concentration signal.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Rank + bin into 5% groups (ventiles) and compare to a 5% “even share” baseline</strong>
            <div class="score">Score: −0.5 (mildly deceptive)</div>
            <p>Binning makes the distribution easy to scan and the 5% baseline gives a crisp fairness yardstick. It implicitly assumes equal exposure across officers, which isn’t strictly true (assignments and complainant behavior vary). I weighed an unbinned Lorenz curve; ventiles won because they’re easier to read at a glance.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Desaturate the first 17 bins; apply a warm ramp only to the right tail</strong>
            <div class="score">Score: −1.0 (deceptive framing)</div>
            <p>The gray body of the chart recedes while the last few bins (including the top 5%) pop. This focuses attention on concentration without changing scales. I rejected icons/photos and heavy labeling as too gimmicky.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Explicit callout of the top 5% (13.6%) with “2.7× above fair-share.”</strong>
            <div class="score">Score: −0.5 (rhetorical emphasis)</div>
            <p>The annotation translates a subtle gap into a memorable multiple. It’s accurate, but the choice to emphasize a multiple (rather than, say, the Gini) heightens perceived disparity.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Full, non-truncated y-axis with a dotted “even share (5%)” line</strong>
            <div class="score">Score: +1.5 (earnest)</div>
            <p>Keeping a 0 baseline and showing the 5% reference guards against false magnification. I considered cropping the y-axis to 3–9% for punch; I kept the full scale to avoid exaggeration.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="sideB.jpg" alt="Horizontal stacked 100 percent bar chart showing share of closed CCRB complaints (1985–2020). Primary subject is a single full-width bar divided into Not substantiated on the left about 75.1 percent and Substantiated on the right about 24.9 percent. The left Not substantiated block is internally split into Exonerated 28.8 percent and Unsubstantiated 46.3 percent. Visible text labels include Not substantiated (Exonerated + Unsubstantiated) ≈ 75.1%, Exonerated 28.8%, Unsubstantiated 46.3%, Substantiated ≈ 24.9%, and x axis label Share of closed complaints (%). A dashed vertical 50 percent reference line is shown. The image is a neutral, evidence-focused chart intended to inform rather than evoke emotion." width="600" />
          <figcaption>Closed complaints only (1985–2020). ‘Not substantiated’ = Exonerated + Unsubstantiated. Single 100% bar with an internal split; 50% reference line. Ratio ≈ 3.0× not-substantiated : substantiated.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <h4>AGAINST the Proposition — Figure 2</h4>
        <ul class="method-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Outcome recode: Exonerated + Unsubstantiated → “Not substantiated.”</strong>
            <div class="score">Score: −1.5 (meaningfully deceptive)</div>
            <p>Collapsing two legally distinct outcomes into one category simplifies the message that most allegations do not end in proof. It’s defensible for a compositional view, but it risks implying “no wrongdoing,” which isn’t what “unsubstantiated” means. I state the mapping on-plot to surface that choice.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Single 100% bar with an internal split (composition, not counts)</strong>
            <div class="score">Score: −0.5 (mildly deceptive)</div>
            <p>A stacked bar makes the ratio salient and downplays time or base-rates. Alternatives (three side-by-side bars or a time series) add nuance but weaken the headline.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Color semantics: calm teal for “Not substantiated;” light gray for “Substantiated.”</strong>
            <div class="score">Score: −1.0 (deceptive framing)</div>
            <p>The palette cues “reassuring majority” vs. “quiet minority.” I avoided alarm colors to keep the emphasis on the left block.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Badge: “≈ 3 in 4 not substantiated” (instead of “≈ 1 in 4 substantiated”).</strong>
            <div class="score">Score: −0.5 (rhetorical emphasis)</div>
            <p>Both are true; this wording reinforces the counter-argument. I kept the ratio (≈3.0×) in the title to preserve quant precision.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Micro-labels for Exonerated vs. Unsubstantiated; minimal mid-block text</strong>
            <div class="score">Score: +0.5 (slightly earnest)</div>
            <p>Small labels along the bottom clarify the internal split and keep the middle clean so the overall share reads first. I considered removing the split entirely (cleaner but less transparent).</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>This project made clear how much framing lives inside seemingly technical choices. In the “FOR” figure, concentration emerges from ranking, binning, and comparing to a 5% even-share baseline. Every step is defensible, yet the baseline encodes a value judgment (that equal shares are the right reference). In the “AGAINST” figure, a different, but still plausible aggregation (Exonerated + Unsubstantiated) flips the narrative. The numbers never changed; the lens did.</p>

        <p>The hardest part was finding the line where persuasion ends and distortion begins. I avoided classic red flags like truncated axes, dual-y tricks, 3D junk, but I did use strategic aggregation, palette, and wording to steer attention. My current definition of ethical analysis/visualization is: make choices that are defensible, disclose those choices near the figure, and demonstrate that alternative, equally defensible choices produce different views of the same data. In practice, that means: document the unit, mappings, filters, and baselines on the plot; prefer accurate encodings; and, when possible, show a sensitivity alternative (such as “proven” vs. “any discipline,” or ventiles vs. a Lorenz curve).</p>

        <p>As for bounds, I’d call acceptable persuasion anything that (1) keeps truthful quantities and scales, (2) states non-obvious transformations on-plot, and (3) would survive a skeptical peer’s replication. Misleading begins when readers can’t recover what was counted (hidden mappings/filters), or when design exaggerates magnitudes (truncated axes, inconsistent scales), or when crucial context (e.g., closed-case filter) is omitted. This assignment sharpened that distinction: both of my visuals are persuasive, and intentionally so, but each includes enough on-plot disclosure that a careful reader can see how the argument was constructed.</p>
